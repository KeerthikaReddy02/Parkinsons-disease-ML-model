# Parkinsons-disease-ML-model
Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the central nervous system that affects movement, often including tremors. I have taken the dataset for the prediction of parkinson's disease from https://www.kaggle.com/dipayanbiswas/parkinsons-disease-speech-signal-features 
Different models such as Logistic regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive bayes, Decision tree and Random forest were implemented to determine best accuracy.
Random forest has best accuracy of all the models with 86.77%
